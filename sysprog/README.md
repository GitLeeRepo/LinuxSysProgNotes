Note that several of these projects use a common.c source file that is linked in the individual Makefiles.  It can be found in my [C_ProgrammingNotes/tree/master/commonlib](https://github.com/GitLeeRepo/C_ProgrammingNotes/tree/master/commonlib) repository.  Adjust the Makefiles accordingly if it is placed in a different directory path than is contained in the individual Makefiles.
